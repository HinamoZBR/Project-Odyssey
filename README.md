# 🌌 Project Odyssey

"Reimagining digital experience through immersive design, interface, and system synergy."

**Project Odyssey** is a long-term UI/UX and OS ecosystem initiative created by **Hinamo (15 y.o, Indonesia)** to challenge and surpass current industry standards (from Android UI to HarmonyOS Next, One UI, and even iOS). Odyssey blends advanced design philosophy with performance-driven interface systems.

# 📖 A Brief History of Project Odyssey

**Project Odyssey** was started **accidentally** when I found a video on TikTok about HarmonyOS Next on PC. I was wondering, "How can they make that? What is the formula?". So, I decided to make this project for surpass current industry standards, and... finding what formula behind HarmonyOS Next (I can't lie, HarmonyOS has very nice UI).

# 🔧 Core Subprojects

 - 🖥️ **AbimoOS**: The primary operating system for Abimo smartphones and tablets. 
 - 🌈 **Aero Vibrant UI**: A universal design system based on glassmorphism and fluent UI. 
 - 🌙 **Lunar OS**: Lightweight OS for Abimo smartwatches. 
 - 🌀 **Orbit**: An OS for desktop and professional computing. 
 - 💧 **HydroXEngine**: Interactive engine for visual AR experiences. 
 - 🌐 **Hydro Visual**: Central UI for LifeBoard©, an immersive AR platform. 

# 🎨 Design Principles

Odyssey incorporates the following styles:

- **Glassmorphism** — transparent layers with depth and clarity.
- **Neuromorphism** — soft, minimal tactile components.
- **Hydromorphism** — fluid-based motion UI with environmental context.
- **Fluent Design** — modern, smooth, and adaptable across devices.

# 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Figma** – UI/UX prototyping
- **AI tools** – Interface & interaction planning
- **Alight Motion** – The initial tool used before Figma 😭
